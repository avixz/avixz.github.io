  <h1>Scope</h1>
  <ul>
  <li>
    Pine Tree <input type="checkbox" checked onClick="return false;" />
    <p>
      Starting from a cyllinder with 8 vertices scale the top vertex loop to make the tip of the tree, do not join completely the vertices yet as we neet to keep the top face to perform other loop cut operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Make 5 horizontal loop cuts. Make additional loop cuts a bit over the first, third and fith loop cuts, select this new loop cuts and scale them out using individual origins as pivot point. Now scale in the original 1, 3 and 5 loop cuts. Move the scaled in loop cuts a bit up in the z axis, now you can merge the vertices in the tip of the tree in the center. Edge slide some loop cuts to get a good three shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the inset tool make a inner circle in the bottom part of the tree and extrude it to form the trunk, make one loop cut and adapt the shape. To give some randomness select the the outer loop cuts from the body of the tree and with proporcional editing activated rotate along the z axis.
